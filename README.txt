To launch the game it's simple

cd game/
npm install electron
node_modules/.bin/electron index.js

DISCLAIMER
==========
The original game is on http://solarus-games.org
and, this project is just a normal continuation in js

but the licence MUST be respected and i don't know how to do ?
perhaps by just saying it's a game i have bought but it's the property of NINTENDO (it's weired)
or the assets are the property of nintendo but i have writed the code, because i love this world of Zelda

so the logo is the same copy as for mystery of solarus with a pixel art of Luke light saber
